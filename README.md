Hello! I'm Hamza Wahhas, a computer science student at Western New England University. I'm passionate about coding and always excited to learn new things.

Interests
- Coding: I love working with Python and Java to solve problems and develop applications. I enjoy exploring different libraries and frameworks to enhance my coding skills.
- Basketball: Basketball is my favorite sport, and I find it a great way to stay active and relieve stress. I enjoy playing with friends and being part of a team.

Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- Transcript Manager: This project was developed using Python and involved building a transcript manager which collected student gpas and allowed the user to retrieve them, remove them and calculate average while using the appropriate data structures to improve speed

- GUI Advanced Calculator: In this project, I used the Python library tkinter to create a gui calcualtor that had the ability of preforming basic calculations. This was further expanded to include a sqroot button and parentheses.

- Lottery Game: I collaborated with a team to develop a lottery application using Java. This lottery system includes many games commonly found in a lottery machine. This includes lottoball, die, wheel and stepperwheel. This program makes use of generics in order to imrpove simplicity

Future Projects

Here are some projects that will be in development soon:

- APIWeatherBasketball: This project uses the weather api call in order to access the weather of Amherst, MA but can also be used for other cities. With that, it checks if the weather is suitable or not to play basketball, and displays a gui canvas to do so. It will resemble a reminder that you would see on a smart phone, almost as an incentive to go play when the weather is good.

Skills
