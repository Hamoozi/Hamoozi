<h1 align="center">Helloüëã, I'm Hamza Wahhas!</h1>

- Coding: I love working with Python and Java to solve problems and develop applications. I enjoy exploring different libraries and frameworks to enhance my coding skills.
- Basketball: Basketball is my favorite sport, and I find it a great way to stay active and relieve stress. I enjoy playing with friends and being part of a team.

Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- [ChatBot](https://github.com/Hamoozi/ChatBot): I am currently developing a ChatBot using Django, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, inspired by ChatGPT, to provide interactive and intelligent conversations in real-time.

- [MarkovGame](https://github.com/Hamoozi/MarkovGame): This project was developed using Python and involves using the classic grid world problem where the user finds the optimal policy by setting rewards and punishments for each square. The moves in the program are compltely deterministic in order to emphasize the optimal path in a real world scenario rather than chance. There are two different size grid world and two Machine learning techniques to find the optimal policy, both of which are explained in depth within the analysis.
- [InstagramClone](https://github.com/Hamoozi/InstagramClone): Currently working on an instagram clone with other students using Django, HTML, CSS for the fullstack application.

- [GUI Advanced Calculator](https://github.com/Hamoozi/GUI-Advanced-Calculator): In this project, I used the Python library tkinter to create a gui calcualtor that had the ability of preforming basic calculations. This was further expanded to include a sqroot button and parentheses. 

- [APIWeatherBasketball](https://github.com/Hamoozi/APIWeatherBasketball): This project uses the weather api call in order to access the weather of Amherst, MA but can also be used for other cities. With that, it checks if the weather is suitable or not to play basketball, and displays a gui canvas to do so. It will resemble a reminder that you would see on a smart phone, almost as an incentive to go play when the weather is good.

- [Lottery Game](https://github.com/Hamoozi/LotteryGame): I collaborated with a team to develop a lottery application using Java. This lottery system includes many games commonly found in a lottery machine. This includes lottoball, die, wheel and stepperwheel. This program makes use of generics in order to imrpove simplicity
